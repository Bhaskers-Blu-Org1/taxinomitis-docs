# Update (26 June 2017)

A lot of the work in the last week was under the covers, but there were some UI improvements worth sharing.

# Update (18 June 2017)

A few worksheets might be a good way to explain how the tool works. I've started a collection at [github.com/dalelane/ml-for-kids/tree/master/worksheets](https://github.com/dalelane/ml-for-kids/tree/master/worksheets)

# Update (15 June 2017)

A little more work on it this week. 

In particular, this shows some extra stuff around user/account management that I hope will make this more appropriate for use with school groups - such as an extra management screen for teachers, and not requiring email addresses for students. 

Also, the start of multi-choice quiz to kill time while students are waiting for ML models to train. I need to come up with some sensible questions for that, though.

# Update (7 June 2017)

This is what I've got working so far. It's still very rough, but I've got some bits working, and it sort of shows where I'm going with this.

# Nothing to see here... yet

I bought this domain, at least in part, because of a special offer eukhost ran: [99p for .co.uk domains](https://twitter.com/eUKhostLtd/status/852551993587507200). 

But I'm not squatting on it... I am actually planning to do something about this. In fact, I'm sort of hoping that now I've invested real money into this idea, that it might spur me into action.

In the meantime, you can see what I'm thinking about by looking through some of my blog posts over the last year. 

In "[The skills implications of Cognitive Computing](http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=3299)" I wrote about why I think it's important that we introduce school children to AI and machine learning. 

In "[An introduction to machine learning with Guess Who](http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=3330)" I shared my first attempt at building an educational project to explain ML, and wrote more about why I think we should do this.

In "[Watson Rock, Paper, Scissors](http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=3349)" I shared a game to train an image recognition classifier to recognise hand shapes.

In "[Machine Learning 'Top Trumps'](http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=3442)" I shared a game I made to explain reinforcement learning, together with the source code for it.

"[Owlbot: Faith's first chatbot](http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=3463)" was about using chatbots as an intro to simple AI.

In "[I-Spy (using Watson services from Scratch projects)](http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=3494)" I showed how I think this could work by integrating with Scratch, rather than inventing something completely new.

As you can see, I've been kicking this idea around for a year now, and sharing my various experiments as I go. I'm more convinced than ever that there is a demand for a general purpose tool that school kids could use to play and experiment with machine learning. I'd like to try and do something about that. And when I do, this is where it'll live.
